## Summary

Between August 2020 and August 2021, I contributed 20 hours per week to a research project alongside my role at [Allplan Österreich GmbH](https://www.allplan.com/at/loesungen/herstellung-von-fertigteilen), in partnership with the [PEEC research group](https://peec.fh-hagenberg.at/) at the [University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria](https://fh-ooe.at/campus-hagenberg) and in collaboration with [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/). My main responsibility was the implementation of a prototype for the semi-automated analysis of collaborative interactions using C# and Python, supported by various AI services. The project culminated in a [research paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/semi-automated-analysis-of-collaborative-interaction-are-we-there-yet/) published in 2022.

## How I joined the project

During my master’s thesis at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, I came across a posting for software developers in this initiative. Since remote and hybrid collaboration had become indispensable during the COVID-19 pandemic, the project addressed a highly relevant topic at the time. I therefore negotiated reduced hours at Allplan to participate, and after completing my degree in July, I joined the project in August.

## Challenges

Automatically analyzing collaboration in images and video proved to be deceptively complex. Even human annotators struggled to distinguish fine-grained interaction types, making manual analysis highly time-consuming. Hybrid and remote work further blurred the boundaries between collaboration modes, complicating reliable automated recognition.

## Project work

We collaborated closely with researchers at Microsoft Research Cambridge, iterating on ideas, methods, and evaluation strategies. My primary responsibility was end-to-end system development: designing, implementing, and integrating components while assessing the feasibility of automatic detection of distinct collaboration processes. To this end, we evaluated a range of AI services and frameworks, including [Microsoft Cognitive Services (now Azure AI Services)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/ai?hl=en), as well as experimental technologies such as [Microsoft Platform for Situated Intelligence (PSI)](https://github.com/microsoft/psi) and [Microsoft Project Tokyo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-tokyo/), to benchmark performance against our objectives.

By the end of the year, we delivered a working prototype and conducted a comprehensive user study to validate its functionality and usefulness. Our findings informed the final design and were published in December 2022, documenting the prototype, methodology, and key lessons learned.
