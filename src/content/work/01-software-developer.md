## The Journey Begins: My First Role in Software Development

After graduating from [HTBLuVA](https://www.htl-salzburg.ac.at/) in 2011 with a degree in Technical Informatics, I began my career as a software developer (C++/C#/Python) at [Allplan Österreich GmbH](https://www.allplan.com/at/loesungen/herstellung-von-fertigteilen) (formerly Nemetschek Engineering).
The company specialized in the further development of the CAD software [Allplan](https://www.allplan.com/), particularly for precast planning. What fascinated me most was that changes were immediately visible in the CAD system—my work always had a direct and tangible impact.

At first, my focus was on enhancing the system for automated plan data generation. Step by step, I took over full responsibility for this area until I was leading both the project management and technical implementation. This task was of central importance, as it was one of the most critical components in our domain.

Another essential part of my work was the development of graphical user interfaces with [Windows Forms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/desktop/winforms/overview/) and [WPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/desktop/wpf/overview/). Over the years, I also expanded my expertise in 3D modeling and data processing.

## Balancing Work and Studies

In 2015, I decided to deepen my knowledge through a part-time bachelor’s degree in [Software Engineering at the University of Applied Sciences Hagenberg](https://fh-ooe.at/studienangebot/software-engineering-bachelor), reducing my working hours to 30 per week. During this time, I increasingly took on responsibility for projects related to 3D data processing.

Among other things, I developed and maintained a Visual Studio extension that enabled 3D data to be visualized directly in the debugger. This tool quickly became indispensable for developers, as it significantly accelerated analysis and debugging. My growing interest in 3D modeling eventually led me to focus my bachelor’s thesis on this area, and I successfully completed the degree.

Afterward, I decided to continue expanding my expertise and therefore pursued a master’s degree in Software Engineering. Since this program was only offered full-time, I reduced my working hours at Allplan to 20 per week. During the program, I was able to broaden my knowledge considerably. My master’s thesis focused on cross-platform development of user interfaces in .NET, where I investigated various technologies such as [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor), [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), and [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/).

Shortly before completing my studies, I was given the opportunity to participate in a [research project](../projects/shctt). The topic was highly relevant at the time and immediately sparked my interest, so I took the chance and worked on the project for about a year alongside my role at Allplan after graduating.

## Promotion

Around the same time, Allplan introduced new career levels (Junior, Developer, Senior), and I was promoted to Senior Developer—a recognition I was very proud of.
