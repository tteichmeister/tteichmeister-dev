## A New Chapter: Becoming a Senior Software Developer

After a short time in my new role at [Allplan Österreich GmbH](https://www.allplan.com/at/loesungen/herstellung-von-fertigteilen), I returned to a full-time position. While the first [research project](../projects/shctt) had already been completed, I was able to contribute to another [project](../projects/carreer-advisory-system) with the same research group for about a year—parallel to my responsibilities at Allplan.
Over the years, I had gradually taken on more responsibility beyond my original role. With my promotion to Senior Software Developer, these responsibilities expanded even further, marking a clear step up in both technical and leadership duties.

## Taking on the Role of a Mentor

In addition to my previous tasks, I increasingly took on the role of a mentor. Training and supporting new team members became a central and personally very meaningful part of my work. A key focus was conveying company-specific frameworks, concepts, workflows, data structures, and coding conventions.

During this period, I also began conducting regular internal training sessions for development teams at Allplan Österreich GmbH. The topics covered included Clean Code, software architecture, and new language features. The aim of these sessions was to close knowledge gaps, establish best practices, and promote technical exchange within the company through ongoing discussions.

## Leading and Developing Key Projects

Another major responsibility was leading a project to optimize and refactor particularly critical software components. The focus was on improving maintainability, readability, and modularization. Given the importance of these modules, we consistently applied Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure high quality and minimize potential errors.

In parallel, I took on another major challenge: the migration of extensive existing user interfaces to WPF. Since the company had set a goal of fully transitioning to [WPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/overview/), the migration of numerous [MFC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/mfc/mfc-desktop-applications?view=msvc-170) and [Windows Forms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/overview/) components became a top priority. The sheer number of interfaces posed a considerable challenge: while some components had to be reimplemented from scratch, others could be migrated efficiently through automation.
To accelerate the process and reduce errors, I developed a tool for the automatic conversion of specific MFC dialogs to WPF. This allowed us to successfully transform more than 60 configuration dialogs in a short period while keeping the error rate extremely low. In comparison, targeted reimplementation of certain components also provided the advantage of significantly increasing performance in those areas.

## Final words

These and many other experiences have had a lasting impact on my time at Allplan Österreich GmbH. Looking back, I am very proud of the contributions I was able to make over the years. During this period, I not only played a key role in important projects and took on greater responsibility, but also continued to grow both professionally and personally.
